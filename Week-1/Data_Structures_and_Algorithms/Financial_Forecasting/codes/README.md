Here there are two java files:
1)FinancialForecast -- Which uses direct recursion technique to predict future values
2)Financial_method2 -- Which uses updated recursion technique, in this program an extra array is used which stores the values of already computed values which helps to avoids recomputation by storing intermediate results.
